Hello,

We at PyDelhi, are a volunteer-driven organization comprising of Pythonistas, enthusiasts, entrepreneurs, researchers, students
and many more with a primary interest in the programming language, Python. We are a healthy community of 11k members conducting
bi-weekly meet-ups, Dev-Sprint, seminars, workshops on different topics related but not limited to Python and its applications
consistently since the past 3+ years. We have collaborated with over 20+ communities to share knowledge and experiences, as well
as have planned meetups with about 100+ venue partners in over the past year. 
Python enthusiasts of all ages, preferences, and skill levels are welcome to join our community and network with like-minded people to learn, collaborate and grow. If you like to know more about us, check out [1][3].

We are always looking for new places and organizations to be our venue sponsors contributing to our vision. Organising a meetup
by us would greatly benefit your venture as listed by us in [2] If you would like to contribute to our cause and help us in
organizing our future meetups, feel free to contact us the undersigned.
