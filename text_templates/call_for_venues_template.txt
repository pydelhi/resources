bi-weekly meet-ups, Dev-Sprint, seminars, workshops on different topics related but not limited to Python and its applications
consistently since the past 3+ years. We have collaborated with over 20+ communities to share knowledge and experiences, as well
as have planned meetups with about 100+ venue partners in over the past year. 
Python enthusiasts of all ages, preferences and skill levels are welcome to join our PyDelhi Group to meet more awesome folks like yourself. If you like to know more about us, check out [1][3].

We are always looking for new places and organizations to be our venue sponsors contributing to our vision. Organising a meetup

organizing our future meetups, feel free to contact us the undersigned.
